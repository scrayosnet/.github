# ScrayosNET

This is the development home of Scrayos UG (haftungsbeschränkt) – a small german company, primarily known for the
development of the Minecraft network [JustChunks][justchunks-website]. This organization holds all public software, that
we decided to create, because we needed it for our own projects.

Feel free to read more about those projects at [our website][scrayosnet-website]!
