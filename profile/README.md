Welcome to the development home of ScrayosNET – a small german company, primarily known for the development of the
Minecraft network [JustChunks][justchunks-website]. We're eager to establish ourselves in the Gaming market and – once
in a while – want to share our technical achievements here. If you're interested in what we're doing and would like to
get into contact (or maybe even join us), hop on the JustChunks [Discord server][justchunks-discord] and say hello!

Feel free to read more about our journey at [our website][scrayosnet-website], where we release blog posts about our
development from time to time!

## Projects

On our journey, we've created a few projects (and on some, we still work today). Read more about our active project and
see what we have in store for the future. We like exploring interesting ideas and making them into reality.

## [JustChunks][justchunks-website]

JustChunks is our Minecraft: Java network with many spectacular games, bundled into a single server. We want our players
to experience Minecraft from a new perspective and introduce our own take on Minecraft based multiplayer!

In contrast to many other Minecraft networks, we don't twist Minecraft in such a way that we can somehow fit our
concepts into it. Instead, we celebrate the mechanics and elements, that make Minecraft such a great game and build our
concepts around Minecraft. That way, we still have all freedoms and can implement astonishing ideas, while we still
profit from everything that Minecraft has to offer. That's also why we're always using the most recent Minecraft
version!

With JustChunks, we want to breathe new life into the Minecraft scene, exploit new possibilities and redesign known
concepts. Our close collaboration with the community and the quality of our implementation are particularly important to
us. We want to offer players a shared home where they can experience a different side of Minecraft with their friends
and where they can let their creativity run free!

## [MC Jobs][mcjobs-website]

Minecraft Jobs (or MC Jobs, for short) is our Minecraft related Job Market. We want to help people discover job
opportunities in the Minecraft scene and support server teams in finding great candidates!

It's a side project that we got the idea for, while working on JustChunks. Minecraft server teams are so unique in their
team composition that we think a site, which deals with the matching of teams and team members, offers much value for
all people involved in this process.

The search for talented and above all ambitious team members is something that we deal with extensively at JustChunks.
And so it is also in our interest to have a service that supports us in this endeavour. In the long term, MC Jobs should
replace the various forum threads in which Minecraft server teams and team members introduce themselves and then try to
find a matching pair. We want to establish a streamlined process that supports the respective parties as much as
possible in finding the optimal counterpart!
